3. Design Decisions:
1. Justification for Microservices Architecture:
A microservices architecture is chosen for the Retail Pricing Feed Management System for the following reasons:
Modular Development: With 3000 stores across multiple countries, a monolithic architecture may lead to complex and intertwined codebases, making it challenging to develop, maintain, and scale. Microservices, on the other hand, allow for modular development, where each microservice focuses on a specific business capability. This modularity enhances code maintainability and facilitates independent development and deployment of services.
Scalability: Microservices provide horizontal scalability, enabling the system to handle increased loads by distributing services across multiple instances or servers. As the number of stores grows or the system experiences increased usage during peak times, individual microservices can be scaled independently to meet the demand. This scalability ensures that the system can efficiently manage data from a large number of retail stores.
Isolation of Failures: In a microservices architecture, failures in one microservice do not necessarily impact others. This isolation improves fault tolerance, resilience, and overall system reliability. If a particular microservice encounters issues, the rest of the system can continue functioning, minimizing the impact on the entire application.
Technology Diversity: Microservices allow the use of different technologies for each service, enabling the selection of the most suitable technology stack for the specific functionality of each microservice. This flexibility facilitates the adoption of technologies that best fit the requirements of individual components, contributing to the overall efficiency of the system.
2. Decision to Use MongoDB for Varied Data Structures:
MongoDB is chosen as the database for the Retail Pricing Feed Management System due to its flexibility in handling varied data structures within pricing records:
Schema-less Design: MongoDB's document-oriented, schema-less design allows the storage of data in a flexible and dynamic format. Pricing records from different stores may have varying attributes, and MongoDB accommodates this variability without the need for a predefined schema. This flexibility is crucial when dealing with diverse pricing information across different retail stores.
Complex Data Structures: Pricing records may contain nested and complex structures, and MongoDB's support for nested arrays and documents makes it well-suited for representing such data. This is advantageous when dealing with products, prices, and associated metadata that may vary between different stores.
Horizontal Scaling: MongoDB's sharding capabilities support horizontal scaling, making it suitable for accommodating the large and growing dataset resulting from pricing records from 3000 stores. This ensures that the system can scale out effectively as the retail chain expands












.
3. Selection of Kafka for Asynchronous Processing - with scalable architecture (refer the scalable diagram):
Kafka is chosen as the message broker for managing asynchronous processing in the Retail Pricing Feed Management System for the following reasons:
Event-Driven Architecture: Kafka facilitates an event-driven architecture, allowing the decoupling of components and services. Events, such as file uploads and data updates, can be asynchronously processed, enhancing the responsiveness of the system. This architecture ensures that different parts of the system can operate independently and respond to events in real-time.
Scalability and Durability: Kafka provides high scalability and durability for handling large volumes of events. It allows the system to process events concurrently, ensuring that file uploads and data updates are efficiently managed. Additionally, Kafka's fault-tolerant design ensures that events are not lost even in the face of failures.
Real-time Processing: Kafka supports real-time data streaming, allowing for immediate processing of events. This is crucial for ensuring that pricing information is updated in near real-time across the system, providing users with the latest and most accurate data.
Loose Coupling: Kafka enables loose coupling between different components of the system. Microservices can communicate asynchronously through Kafka topics, reducing dependencies and enabling each service to evolve independently.
In summary, the choice of a microservices architecture, MongoDB, and Kafka aligns with the requirements of the Retail Pricing Feed Management System, providing modularity, flexibility in data handling, and efficient asynchronous processing for improved system responsiveness.


4. Non-functional Requirements Considered and Addressed:

Certainly, for a retail store chain with 3000 stores across multiple countries, the non-functional requirements are crucial for ensuring the system's effectiveness, scalability, and security. Here's a comprehensive set of non-functional requirements:
1. Scalability:
The system should be capable of handling the data and transactions generated by 3000 stores without significant degradation in performance.
The architecture should support seamless horizontal scaling to accommodate future growth.
2. Performance:
Response time for common operations (e.g., searching, data retrieval, and updates) should be optimized for a large number of concurrent users.
The system should be able to handle peak loads during promotional events or high-traffic periods.
3. Security:
User authentication and authorization mechanisms should be robust, implementing industry-standard protocols such as OAuth 2.0.
Data at rest and in transit must be encrypted to protect sensitive pricing information.
Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments should be conducted.
4. Reliability:
The system should have a high level of availability, minimizing downtime for routine maintenance and updates.
Implement mechanisms for automated backup and recovery to prevent data loss in case of system failures.
5. Availability:
The application should be available 24/7, considering the global presence and different time zones of the retail stores.
Downtime for maintenance activities should be scheduled during off-peak hours.
6. Compliance:
The system should adhere to relevant data protection and privacy regulations across the countries where the retail stores are located.
Ensure compliance with industry standards and best practices.
7. Disaster Recovery:
Have a comprehensive disaster recovery plan in place to quickly restore operations in case of unexpected events such as natural disasters or cyber-attacks.
Regularly test the disaster recovery mechanisms to ensure their effectiveness.
8. Monitoring and Logging:
Implement robust monitoring tools to track system performance, identify potential issues, and provide insights into user behavior.
Logging should capture relevant information for troubleshooting and auditing purposes.
9. Documentation:
Maintain comprehensive documentation for the system architecture, deployment procedures, and API documentation for future reference and onboarding of new team members.
10. Integration:
Ensure seamless integration with other existing systems within the retail chain, such as inventory management and order processing systems.
Support standard protocols for data exchange.
11. Usability:
The user interface should be intuitive, ensuring that users from various countries and backgrounds can easily navigate and perform tasks.
Provide sufficient training and documentation to facilitate user adoption.
12. Network Performance:
Optimize the system for varying network conditions, considering the diverse locations of retail stores with potentially different network infrastructures.
By addressing these non-functional requirements, the Retail Pricing Feed Management System can deliver a reliable, secure, and scalable solution for the retail store chain across multiple countries.












5. Assumptions:
Explicitly state assumptions made during the design process, such as the availability of necessary hardware resources for deployment and regular maintenance.
Assume a stable and reliable network infrastructure for secure data transmission.
